## This is a proposal of what KMF should output when generating for "js"

Proposal of structure:
```
├── built
├── node_modules
│   └── kmf
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── org.kevoree.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

KMF should generate by default a standard CommonJS project with a clean `package.json` and a standard TypeScript project layout.
- **package.json**: classic Node.js package description
 - It should specify the dependency to the desired version of `kmf` (l.12, this should be generated by the KMF MavenPlugin according to the version used **and assuming the KMF team manages the npm releases of the JavaScript/TypeScript versions of KMF independently**)
 - It should specify the path to the **the.model.d.ts** file using the TypeScript standard **typings** (see l.6)
- **tsconfig.json**: classic TypeScript project configuration file
 - It's a pretty straightforward TypeScript compile config file that should be generated using the proper **the.model.ts** naming
- **src/main**: location of the generated model
- **src/test**: location of optional tests ?
- **node_modules**: generated by npm after the dev does `npm install` (and so installs KMF because it is in the dependency)
- **built**: generated by the TypeScript compiler in order to output the JavaScript and TypeScript Declaration files (so after a `tsc` at the root of the project)


### Note:
:warning: The only problem when splitting TypeScript generated files for KMF is that KMF has to handle the naming redeclaration:

```ts
class Foo {
	foo() {
		var bar = new bar.Bar();
		// Here, you cannot access namespace "bar" anymore...
		// KMF should know that and rename the local variable to something else
		// so that anywhere in the code you can reach other namespaces
		bar.doSomething();
	}
}

export namespace bar {
	class Bar {
		doSomething() {
			// ...
		}
	}
}
```
So, the KMF java2typescript SourceTranslator has to be a bit more clever in order to handle those edge cases
